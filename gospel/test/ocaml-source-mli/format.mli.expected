  " Pretty-printing.\n\n   This module implements a pretty-printing facility to format values\n   within {{!boxes}'pretty-printing boxes'} and {{!tags}'semantic tags'}\n   combined with a set of {{!fpp}printf-like functions}.\n   The pretty-printer splits lines at specified {{!breaks}break hints},\n   and indents lines according to the box structure.\n   Similarly, {{!tags}semantic tags} can be used to decouple text\n   presentation from its contents.\n\n   This pretty-printing facility is implemented as an overlay on top of\n   abstract {{!section:formatter}formatters} which provide basic output\n   functions.\n   Some formatters are predefined, notably:\n   - {!std_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stdout}stdout}\n   - {!err_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stderr}stderr}\n\n   Most functions in the {!Format} module come in two variants:\n   a short version that operates on {!std_formatter} and the\n   generic version prefixed by [pp_] that takes a formatter\n   as its first argument.\n\n   More formatters can be created with {!formatter_of_out_channel},\n   {!formatter_of_buffer}, {!formatter_of_symbolic_output_buffer}\n   or using {{!section:formatter}custom formatters}.\n\n"]

  " {1 Introduction}\n   For a gentle introduction to the basics of pretty-printing using\n   [Format], read\n   {{:http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}\n    http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}.\n\n   You may consider this module as providing an extension to the\n   [printf] facility to provide automatic line splitting. The addition of\n   pretty-printing annotations to your regular [printf] format strings gives\n   you fancy indentation and line breaks.\n   Pretty-printing annotations are described below in the documentation of\n   the function {!Format.fprintf}.\n\n   You may also use the explicit pretty-printing box management and printing\n   functions provided by this module. This style is more basic but more\n   verbose than the concise [fprintf] format strings.\n\n   For instance, the sequence\n   [open_box 0; print_string \"x =\"; print_space ();\n    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()]\n   that prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing box, can be\n   abbreviated as [printf \"@[%s@ %i@]@.\" \"x =\" 1], or even shorter\n   [printf \"@[x =@ %i@]@.\" 1].\n\n   Rule of thumb for casual users of this library:\n - use simple pretty-printing boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);\n - use simple break hints as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a\n   simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that outputs a space\n   indicating a break hint;\n - once a pretty-printing box is open, display its material with basic\n   printing functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);\n - when the material for a pretty-printing box has been printed, call\n   [close_box ()] to close the box;\n - at the end of pretty-printing, flush the pretty-printer to display all\n   the remaining material, e.g. evaluate [print_newline ()].\n\n   The behavior of pretty-printing commands is unspecified\n   if there is no open pretty-printing box. Each box opened by\n   one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]\n   for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the\n   boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly.\n\n   In case of interactive use, each phrase is executed in the initial state\n   of the standard pretty-printer: after each phrase execution, the\n   interactive system closes all open pretty-printing boxes, flushes all\n   pending text, and resets the standard pretty-printer.\n\n   Warning: mixing calls to pretty-printing functions of this module with\n   calls to {!Stdlib} low level output functions is error prone.\n\n   The pretty-printing functions output material that is delayed in the\n   pretty-printer queue and stacks in order to compute proper line\n   splitting. In contrast, basic I/O output functions write directly in\n   their output device. As a consequence, the output of a basic I/O function\n   may appear before the output of a pretty-printing function that has been\n   called before. For instance,\n   [\n    Stdlib.print_string \"<\";\n    Format.print_string \"PRETTY\";\n    Stdlib.print_string \">\";\n    Format.print_string \"TEXT\";\n   ]\n   leads to output [<>PRETTYTEXT].\n\n"]

  " The pretty-printing engine uses the concepts of pretty-printing box and\n  break hint to drive indentation and line splitting behavior of the\n  pretty-printer.\n\n  Each different pretty-printing box kind introduces a specific line splitting\n  policy:\n\n  - within an {e horizontal} box, break hints never split the line (but the\n    line may be split in a box nested deeper),\n  - within a {e vertical} box, break hints always split the line,\n  - within an {e horizontal/vertical} box, if the box fits on the current line\n    then break hints never split the line, otherwise break hint always split\n    the line,\n  - within a {e compacting} box, a break hint never splits the line,\n    unless there is no more room on the current line.\n\n  Note that line splitting policy is box specific: the policy of a box does\n  not rule the policy of inner boxes. For instance, if a vertical box is\n  nested in an horizontal box, all break hints within the vertical box will\n  split the line.\n"]

                " {i Semantic tags} (or simply {e tags}) are user's defined annotations\n  to associate user's specific operations to printed entities.\n\n  Common usage of semantic tags is text decoration to get specific font or\n  text size rendering for a display device, or marking delimitation of\n  entities (e.g. HTML or TeX elements or terminal escape sequences).\n  More sophisticated usage of semantic tags could handle dynamic\n  modification of the pretty-printer behavior to properly print the material\n  within some specific tags.\n  For instance, we can define an RGB tag like so:\n{[\ntype stag += RGB of {r:int;g:int;b:int}\n]}\n\n  In order to properly delimit printed entities, a semantic tag must be\n  opened before and closed after the entity. Semantic tags must be properly\n  nested like parentheses using {!pp_open_stag} and {!pp_close_stag}.\n\n  Tag specific operations occur any time a tag is opened or closed, At each\n  occurrence, two kinds of operations are performed {e tag-marking} and\n  {e tag-printing}:\n- The tag-marking operation is the simpler tag specific operation: it simply\n  writes a tag specific string into the output device of the\n  formatter. Tag-marking does not interfere with line-splitting computation.\n- The tag-printing operation is the more involved tag specific operation: it\n  can print arbitrary material to the formatter. Tag-printing is tightly\n  linked to the current pretty-printer operations.\n\n  Roughly speaking, tag-marking is commonly used to get a better rendering of\n  texts in the rendering device, while tag-printing allows fine tuning of\n  printing routines to print the same entity differently according to the\n  semantic tags (i.e. print additional material or even omit parts of the\n  output).\n\n  More precisely: when a semantic tag is opened or closed then both and\n  successive 'tag-printing' and 'tag-marking' operations occur:\n  - Tag-printing a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function\n  [print_open_stag] (resp. [print_close_stag]) with the name of the tag as\n  argument: that tag-printing function can then print any regular material\n  to the formatter (so that this material is enqueued as usual in the\n  formatter queue for further line splitting computation).\n  - Tag-marking a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function\n  [mark_open_stag] (resp. [mark_close_stag]) with the name of the tag as\n  argument: that tag-marking function can then return the 'tag-opening\n  marker' (resp. `tag-closing marker') for direct output into the output\n  device of the formatter.\n\n  Being written directly into the output device of the formatter, semantic\n  tag marker strings are not considered as part of the printing material that\n  drives line splitting (in other words, the length of the strings\n  corresponding to tag markers is considered as zero for line splitting).\n\n  Thus, semantic tag handling is in some sense transparent to pretty-printing\n  and does not interfere with usual indentation. Hence, a single\n  pretty-printing routine can output both simple 'verbatim' material or\n  richer decorated output depending on the treatment of tags. By default,\n  tags are not active, hence the output is not decorated with tag\n  information. Once [set_tags] is set to [true], the pretty-printer engine\n  honors tags and decorates the output accordingly.\n\n  Default tag-marking functions behave the HTML way: {{!tag}string tags} are\n  enclosed in \"<\" and \">\" while other tags are ignored;\n  hence, opening marker for tag string [\"t\"] is [\"<t>\"] and closing marker\n  is [\"</t>\"].\n\n  Default tag-printing functions just do nothing.\n\n  Tag-marking and tag-printing functions are user definable and can\n  be set by calling {!set_formatter_stag_functions}.\n\n  Semantic tag operations may be set on or off with {!set_tags}.\n  Tag-marking operations may be set on or off with {!set_mark_tags}.\n  Tag-printing operations may be set on or off with {!set_print_tags}.\n"]

The\n    [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break hint may be\n    optionally specified with the following syntax:\n    the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,\n    then an integer [offset], and a closing [>] character.\n    If no parameters are provided, the good break defaults to a\n    'space' break hint.\n  - [@.]: flush the pretty-printer and split the line, as with\n    [print_newline ()].\n  - [@<n>]: print the following item as if it were of length [n].\n    Hence, [printf \"@<0>%s\" arg] prints [arg] as a zero length string.\n    If [@<n>] is not followed by a conversion specification,\n    then the following character of the format is printed as if\n    it were of length [n].\n  - [@\\{]: open a semantic tag. The name of the tag may be optionally\n    specified with the following syntax:\n    the [<] character, followed by an optional string\n    specification, and the closing [>] character. The string\n    specification is any character string that does not contain the\n    closing character ['>'].

  " {1 Introduction}\n   For a gentle introduction to the basics of pretty-printing using\n   [Format], read\n   {{:http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}\n    http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}.\n\n   You may consider this module as providing an extension to the\n   [printf] facility to provide automatic line splitting. The addition of\n   pretty-printing annotations to your regular [printf] format strings gives\n   you fancy indentation and line breaks.\n   Pretty-printing annotations are described below in the documentation of\n   the function {!Format.fprintf}.\n\n   You may also use the explicit pretty-printing box management and printing\n   functions provided by this module. This style is more basic but more\n   verbose than the concise [fprintf] format strings.\n\n   For instance, the sequence\n   [open_box 0; print_string \"x =\"; print_space ();\n    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()]\n   that prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing box, can be\n   abbreviated as [printf \"@[%s@ %i@]@.\" \"x =\" 1], or even shorter\n   [printf \"@[x =@ %i@]@.\" 1].\n\n   Rule of thumb for casual users of this library:\n - use simple pretty-printing boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);\n - use simple break hints as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a\n   simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that outputs a space\n   indicating a break hint;\n - once a pretty-printing box is open, display its material with basic\n   printing functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);\n - when the material for a pretty-printing box has been printed, call\n   [close_box ()] to close the box;\n - at the end of pretty-printing, flush the pretty-printer to display all\n   the remaining material, e.g. evaluate [print_newline ()].\n\n   The behavior of pretty-printing commands is unspecified\n   if there is no open pretty-printing box. Each box opened by\n   one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]\n   for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the\n   boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly.\n\n   In case of interactive use, each phrase is executed in the initial state\n   of the standard pretty-printer: after each phrase execution, the\n   interactive system closes all open pretty-printing boxes, flushes all\n   pending text, and resets the standard pretty-printer.\n\n   Warning: mixing calls to pretty-printing functions of this module with\n   calls to {!Stdlib} low level output functions is error prone.\n\n   The pretty-printing functions output material that is delayed in the\n   pretty-printer queue and stacks in order to compute proper line\n   splitting. In contrast, basic I/O output functions write directly in\n   their output device. As a consequence, the output of a basic I/O function\n   may appear before the output of a pretty-printing function that has been\n   called before. For instance,\n   [\n    Stdlib.print_string \"<\";\n    Format.print_string \"PRETTY\";\n    Stdlib.print_string \">\";\n    Format.print_string \"TEXT\";\n   ]\n   leads to output [<>PRETTYTEXT].\n\n"]

  " The pretty-printing engine uses the concepts of pretty-printing box and\n  break hint to drive indentation and line splitting behavior of the\n  pretty-printer.\n\n  Each different pretty-printing box kind introduces a specific line splitting\n  policy:\n\n  - within an {e horizontal} box, break hints never split the line (but the\n    line may be split in a box nested deeper),\n  - within a {e vertical} box, break hints always split the line,\n  - within an {e horizontal/vertical} box, if the box fits on the current line\n    then break hints never split the line, otherwise break hint always split\n    the line,\n  - within a {e compacting} box, a break hint never splits the line,\n    unless there is no more room on the current line.\n\n  Note that line splitting policy is box specific: the policy of a box does\n  not rule the policy of inner boxes.

                " {i Semantic tags} (or simply {e tags}) are user's defined annotations\n  to associate user's specific operations to printed entities.\n\n  Common usage of semantic tags is text decoration to get specific font or\n  text size rendering for a display device, or marking delimitation of\n  entities (e.g. HTML or TeX elements or terminal escape sequences).\n  More sophisticated usage of semantic tags could handle dynamic\n  modification of the pretty-printer behavior to properly print the material\n  within some specific tags.\n  For instance, we can define an RGB tag like so:\n{[\ntype stag += RGB of {r:int;g:int;b:int}\n]}\n\n  In order to properly delimit printed entities, a semantic tag must be\n  opened before and closed after the entity. Semantic tags must be properly\n  nested like parentheses using {!pp_open_stag} and {!pp_close_stag}.\n\n  Tag specific operations occur any time a tag is opened or closed, At each\n  occurrence, two kinds of operations are performed {e tag-marking} and\n  {e tag-printing}:\n- The tag-marking operation is the simpler tag specific operation: it simply\n  writes a tag specific string into the output device of the\n  formatter. Tag-marking does not interfere with line-splitting computation.\n- The tag-printing operation is the more involved tag specific operation: it\n  can print arbitrary material to the formatter. Tag-printing is tightly\n  linked to the current pretty-printer operations.\n\n  Roughly speaking, tag-marking is commonly used to get a better rendering of\n  texts in the rendering device, while tag-printing allows fine tuning of\n  printing routines to print the same entity differently according to the\n  semantic tags (i.e. print additional material or even omit parts of the\n  output).\n\n  More precisely: when a semantic tag is opened or closed then both and\n  successive 'tag-printing' and 'tag-marking' operations occur:\n  - Tag-printing a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function\n  [print_open_stag] (resp. [print_close_stag]) with the name of the tag as\n  argument: that tag-printing function can then print any regular material\n  to the formatter (so that this material is enqueued as usual in the\n  formatter queue for further line splitting computation).\n  - Tag-marking a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function\n  [mark_open_stag] (resp. [mark_close_stag]) with the name of the tag as\n  argument: that tag-marking function can then return the 'tag-opening\n  marker' (resp. `tag-closing marker') for direct output into the output\n  device of the formatter.\n\n  Being written directly into the output device of the formatter, semantic\n  tag marker strings are not considered as part of the printing material that\n  drives line splitting (in other words, the length of the strings\n  corresponding to tag markers is considered as zero for line splitting).\n\n  Thus, semantic tag handling is in some sense transparent to pretty-printing\n  and does not interfere with usual indentation. Hence, a single\n  pretty-printing routine can output both simple 'verbatim' material or\n  richer decorated output depending on the treatment of tags. By default,\n  tags are not active, hence the output is not decorated with tag\n  information. Once [set_tags] is set to [true], the pretty-printer engine\n  honors tags and decorates the output accordingly.\n\n  Default tag-marking functions behave the HTML way: {{!tag}string tags} are\n  enclosed in \"<\" and \">\" while other tags are ignored;\n  hence, opening marker for tag string [\"t\"] is [\"<t>\"] and closing marker\n  is [\"</t>\"].\n\n  Default tag-printing functions just do nothing.\n\n  Tag-marking and tag-printing functions are user definable and can\n  be set by calling {!set_formatter_stag_functions}.\n\n  Semantic tag operations may be set on or off with {!set_tags}.\n  Tag-marking operations may be set on or off with {!set_mark_tags}.\n  Tag-printing operations may be set on or off with {!set_print_tags}.\n"]

  " [fprintf ff fmt arg1 ... argN] formats the arguments [arg1] to [argN]\n  according to the format string [fmt], and outputs the resulting string on\n  the formatter [ff].\n\n  The format string [fmt] is a character string which contains three types of\n  objects: plain characters and conversion specifications as specified in\n  the {!Printf} module, and pretty-printing indications specific to the\n  [Format] module.\n\n  The pretty-printing indication characters are introduced by\n  a [@] character, and their meanings are:\n  - [@\\[]: open a pretty-printing box. The type and offset of the\n    box may be optionally specified with the following syntax:\n    the [<] character, followed by an optional box type indication,\n    then an optional integer offset, and the closing [>] character.\n    Pretty-printing box type is one of [h], [v], [hv], [b], or [hov].\n    '[h]' stands for an 'horizontal' pretty-printing box,\n    '[v]' stands for a 'vertical' pretty-printing box,\n    '[hv]' stands for an 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box,\n    '[b]' stands for an 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box\n    demonstrating indentation,\n    '[hov]' stands a simple 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box.\n    For instance, [@\\[<hov 2>] opens an 'horizontal-or-vertical'\n    pretty-printing box with indentation 2 as obtained with [open_hovbox 2].\n    For more details about pretty-printing boxes, see the various box opening\n    functions [open_*box].\n  - [@\\]]: close the most recently opened pretty-printing box.\n  - [@,]: output a 'cut' break hint, as with [print_cut ()].\n  - [@ ]: output a 'space' break hint, as with [print_space ()].\n  - [@;]: output a 'full' break hint as with [print_break]. The\n    [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break hint may be\n    optionally specified with the following syntax:\n    the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,\n    then an integer [offset], and a closing [>] character.\n    If no parameters are provided, the good break defaults to a\n    'space' break hint.\n  - [@.]: flush the pretty-printer and split the line, as with\n    [print_newline ()].\n  - [@<n>]: print the following item as if it were of length [n].\n    Hence, [printf \"@<0>%s\" arg] prints [arg] as a zero length string.\n    If [@<n>] is not followed by a conversion specification,\n    then the following character of the format is printed as if\n    it were of length [n].\n  - [@\\{]: open a semantic tag. The name of the tag may be optionally\n    specified with the following syntax:\n    the [<] character, followed by an optional string\n    specification, and the closing [>] character. The string\n    specification is any character string that does not contain the\n    closing character ['>']. If omitted, the tag name defaults to the\n    empty string.\n    For more details about semantic tags, see the functions {!open_stag} and\n    {!close_stag}.\n  - [@\\}]: close the most recently opened semantic tag.\n  - [@?]: flush the pretty-printer as with [print_flush ()].\n    This is equivalent to the conversion [%!].\n  - [@\\n]: force a newline, as with [force_newline ()], not the normal way\n    of pretty-printing, you should prefer using break hints inside a vertical\n    pretty-printing box.\n\n  Note: To prevent the interpretation of a [@] character as a\n  pretty-printing indication, escape it with a [%] character.\n  Old quotation mode [@@] is deprecated since it is not compatible with\n  formatted input interpretation of character ['@'].\n\n  Example: [printf \"@[%s@ %d@]@.\" \"x =\" 1] is equivalent to\n  [open_box (); print_string \"x =\"; print_space ();\n   print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()].\n  It prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing 'horizontal-or-vertical' box.\n\n"]
