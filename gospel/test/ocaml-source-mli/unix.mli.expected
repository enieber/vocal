The data contained in\n  this big array are the contents of the file referred to by\n  the file descriptor [fd] (as opened previously with\n  [Unix.openfile], for example).  The optional [pos] parameter\n  is the byte offset in the file of the data being mapped;\n  it defaults to 0 (map from the beginning of the file).\n\n  If [shared] is [true], all modifications performed on the array\n  are reflected in the file.

If [shared] is [false], modifications\n  performed on the array are done in memory only, using\n  copy-on-write of the modified pages; the underlying file is not\n  affected.\n\n  [Genarray.map_file] is much more efficient than reading\n  the whole file in a big array, modifying that big array,\n  and writing it afterwards.\n\n  To adjust automatically the dimensions of the big array to\n  the actual size of the file, the major dimension (that is,\n  the first dimension for an array with C layout, and the last\n  dimension for an array with Fortran layout) can be given as\n  [-1].  [Genarray.map_file] then determines the major dimension\n  from the size of the file.  The file must contain an integral\n  number of sub-arrays as determined by the non-major dimensions,\n  otherwise [Failure] is raised.\n\n  If all dimensions of the big array are given, the file size is\n  matched against the size of the big array.  If the file is larger\n  than the big array, only the initial portion of the file is\n  mapped to the big array.  If the file is smaller than the big\n  array, the file is automatically grown to the size of the big array.\n  This requires write permissions on [fd].\n\n  Array accesses are bounds-checked, but the bounds are determined by\n  the initial call to [map_file]. Therefore, you should make sure no\n  other process modifies the mapped file while you're accessing it,\n  or a SIGBUS signal may be raised.

Hence, it is\n   highly recommended to set all file descriptors ``close-on-exec'',\n   except in the very few cases where a file descriptor actually needs\n   to be transmitted to another program.\n\n   The best way to set a file descriptor ``close-on-exec'' is to create\n   it in this state.  To this end, the [openfile] function has\n   [O_CLOEXEC] and [O_KEEPEXEC] flags to enforce ``close-on-exec'' mode\n   or ``keep-on-exec'' mode, respectively.  All other operations in\n   the Unix module that create file descriptors have an optional\n   argument [?cloexec:bool] to indicate whether the file descriptor\n   should be created in ``close-on-exec'' mode (by writing\n   [~cloexec:true]) or in ``keep-on-exec'' mode (by writing\n   [~cloexec:false]).  For historical reasons, the default file\n   descriptor creation mode is ``keep-on-exec'', if no [cloexec] optional\n   argument is given.  This is not a safe default, hence it is highly\n   recommended to pass explicit [cloexec] arguments to operations that\n   create file descriptors.\n\n   The [cloexec] optional arguments and the [O_KEEPEXEC] flag were introduced\n   in OCaml 4.05.  Earlier, the common practice was to create file descriptors\n   in the default, ``keep-on-exec'' mode, then call [set_close_on_exec]\n   on those freshly-created file descriptors.  This is not as safe as\n   creating the file descriptor in ``close-on-exec'' mode because, in\n   multithreaded programs, a window of vulnerability exists between the time\n   when the file descriptor is created and the time [set_close_on_exec]\n   completes.  If another thread spawns another program during this window,\n   the descriptor will leak, as it is still in the ``keep-on-exec'' mode.\n\n   Regarding the atomicity guarantees given by [~cloexec:true] or by\n   the use of the [O_CLOEXEC] flag: on all platforms it is guaranteed\n   that a concurrently-executing Caml thread cannot leak the descriptor\n   by starting a new process.  On Linux, this guarantee extends to\n   concurrently-executing C threads.  As of Feb 2017, other operating\n   systems lack the necessary system calls and still expose a window\n   of vulnerability during which a C thread can see the newly-created\n   file descriptor in ``keep-on-exec'' mode.\n "]

Therefore, you should make sure no\n  other process modifies the mapped file while you're accessing it,\n  or a SIGBUS signal may be raised.

Hence, it is\n   highly recommended to set all file descriptors ``close-on-exec'',\n   except in the very few cases where a file descriptor actually needs\n   to be transmitted to another program.\n\n   The best way to set a file descriptor ``close-on-exec'' is to create\n   it in this state.  To this end, the [openfile] function has\n   [O_CLOEXEC] and [O_KEEPEXEC] flags to enforce ``close-on-exec'' mode\n   or ``keep-on-exec'' mode, respectively.  All other operations in\n   the Unix module that create file descriptors have an optional\n   argument [?cloexec:bool] to indicate whether the file descriptor\n   should be created in ``close-on-exec'' mode (by writing\n   [~cloexec:true]) or in ``keep-on-exec'' mode (by writing\n   [~cloexec:false]).  For historical reasons, the default file\n   descriptor creation mode is ``keep-on-exec'', if no [cloexec] optional\n   argument is given.  This is not a safe default, hence it is highly\n   recommended to pass explicit [cloexec] arguments to operations that\n   create file descriptors.\n\n   The [cloexec] optional arguments and the [O_KEEPEXEC] flag were introduced\n   in OCaml 4.05.  Earlier, the common practice was to create file descriptors\n   in the default, ``keep-on-exec'' mode, then call [set_close_on_exec]\n   on those freshly-created file descriptors.  This is not as safe as\n   creating the file descriptor in ``close-on-exec'' mode because, in\n   multithreaded programs, a window of vulnerability exists between the time\n   when the file descriptor is created and the time [set_close_on_exec]\n   completes.  If another thread spawns another program during this window,\n   the descriptor will leak, as it is still in the ``keep-on-exec'' mode.\n\n   Regarding the atomicity guarantees given by [~cloexec:true] or by\n   the use of the [O_CLOEXEC] flag: on all platforms it is guaranteed\n   that a concurrently-executing Caml thread cannot leak the descriptor\n   by starting a new process.  On Linux, this guarantee extends to\n   concurrently-executing C threads.  As of Feb 2017, other operating\n   systems lack the necessary system calls and still expose a window\n   of vulnerability during which a C thread can see the newly-created\n   file descriptor in ``keep-on-exec'' mode.\n "]
