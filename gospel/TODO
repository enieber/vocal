* dune (instead of ocamlbuild)

  - compilation as a library as well

  - a better name for the executable, e.g. gospel-tc?

  - installation, together with the GOSPEL standard library

  - opam package

* GOSPEL language

  - consumes/modifies currently accept terms as arguments -> limit
    them to paths x.y.z?

  - reads?

  - alias?

  - infix identifier operators, for instance with a syntax such as x
    `union` y

    a particular case for mod without back ticks?
    (i.e. 42 mod 7 like in OCaml and not 42  `mod` 7)

* GOSPEL implementation

  - pattern matching on values of type 'integer'?

  - fail/warn on 'old' being used on terms which are not listed in the
    'writes' clause?

  - fail/warn on terms being consumed and referred to in
    postconditions (without 'old')?

* standard library

  - needs a full review

  - only contains what is necessary to typecheck the vocal library

* documentation

  - some minimal LaTeX doc exists in doc-plain/ (the grammar), and is
    not up to date

  - replace it with some HTML documentation, along the lines of
    https://golang.org/ref/spec

  - some gospeldoc tool to translate GOSPEL files to HTML, to be used
    to documentation the GOSPEL library in particular

    several possibilities:
    - pre-process GOSPEL files and then use ocamldoc
    - patch ocamldoc
    - parse the GOSPEL files with the GOSPEL library and then output HTML
