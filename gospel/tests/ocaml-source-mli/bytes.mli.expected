  " Byte sequence operations.\n\n   A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a\n   fixed-length sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in\n   constant time for reading or writing.\n\n   Given a byte sequence [s] of length [l], we can access each of the\n   [l] bytes of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at\n   [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the\n   range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two\n   bytes or at the beginning or end of the sequence.  We call a\n   position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]\n   (inclusive). Note that the byte at index [n] is between positions\n   [n] and [n+1].\n\n   Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid\n   range of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are valid\n   positions in [s].\n\n   Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the [set]\n   and [blit] functions described below.  See also strings (module\n   {!String}), which are almost the same data structure, but cannot be\n   modified in place.\n\n   Bytes are represented by the OCaml type [char].\n\n   @since 4.02.0\n "]

                                        " Unsafely convert a byte sequence into a string.\n\n    To reason about the use of [unsafe_to_string], it is convenient to\n    consider an \"ownership\" discipline. A piece of code that\n    manipulates some data \"owns\" it; there are several disjoint ownership\n    modes, including:\n    - Unique ownership: the data may be accessed and mutated\n    - Shared ownership: the data has several owners, that may only\n      access it, not mutate it.\n\n    Unique ownership is linear: passing the data to another piece of\n    code means giving up ownership (we cannot write the\n    data again). A unique owner may decide to make the data shared\n    (giving up mutation rights on it), but shared data may not become\n    uniquely-owned again.\n\n   [unsafe_to_string s] can only be used when the caller owns the byte\n   sequence [s] -- either uniquely or as shared immutable data. The\n   caller gives up ownership of [s], and gains ownership of the\n   returned string.\n\n   There are two valid use-cases that respect this ownership\n   discipline:\n\n   1. Creating a string by initializing and mutating a byte sequence\n   that is never changed after initialization is performed.\n\n   {[\nlet string_init len f : string =\n  let s = Bytes.create len in\n  for i = 0 to len - 1 do Bytes.set s i (f i) done;\n  Bytes.unsafe_to_string s\n   ]}\n\n   This function is safe because the byte sequence [s] will never be\n   accessed or mutated after [unsafe_to_string] is called. The\n   [string_init] code gives up ownership of [s], and returns the\n   ownership of the resulting string to its caller.\n\n   Note that it would be unsafe if [s] was passed as an additional\n   parameter to the function [f] as it could escape this way and be\n   mutated in the future -- [string_init] would give up ownership of\n   [s] to pass it to [f], and could not call [unsafe_to_string]\n   safely.\n\n   We have provided the {!String.init}, {!String.map} and\n   {!String.mapi} functions to cover most cases of building\n   new strings. You should prefer those over [to_string] or\n   [unsafe_to_string] whenever applicable.\n\n   2. Temporarily giving ownership of a byte sequence to a function\n   that expects a uniquely owned string and returns ownership back, so\n   that we can mutate the sequence again after the call ended.\n\n   {[\nlet bytes_length (s : bytes) =\n  String.length (Bytes.unsafe_to_string s)\n   ]}\n\n   In this use-case, we do not promise that [s] will never be mutated\n   after the call to [bytes_length s]. The {!String.length} function\n   temporarily borrows unique ownership of the byte sequence\n   (and sees it as a [string]), but returns this ownership back to\n   the caller, which may assume that [s] is still a valid byte\n   sequence after the call. Note that this is only correct because we\n   know that {!String.length} does not capture its argument -- it could\n   escape by a side-channel such as a memoization combinator.\n\n   The caller may not mutate [s] while the string is borrowed (it has\n   temporarily given up ownership). This affects concurrent programs,\n   but also higher-order functions: if {!String.length} returned\n   a closure to be called later, [s] should not be mutated until this\n   closure is fully applied and returns ownership.\n"]
val unsafe_of_string : string -> bytes[@@ocaml.doc
                                        " Unsafely convert a shared string to a byte sequence that should\n    not be mutated.\n\n    The same ownership discipline that makes [unsafe_to_string]\n    correct applies to [unsafe_of_string]: you may use it if you were\n    the owner of the [string] value, and you will own the return\n    [bytes] in the same mode.\n\n    In practice, unique ownership of string values is extremely\n    difficult to reason about correctly. You should always assume\n    strings are shared, never uniquely owned.\n\n    For example, string literals are implicitly shared by the\n    compiler, so you never uniquely own them.\n\n    {[\nlet incorrect = Bytes.unsafe_of_string \"hello\"\nlet s = Bytes.of_string \"hello\"\n    ]}\n\n    The first declaration is incorrect, because the string literal\n    [\"hello\"] could be shared by the compiler with other parts of the\n    program, and mutating [incorrect] is a bug. You must always use\n    the second version, which performs a copy and is thus correct.\n\n    Assuming unique ownership of strings that are not string\n    literals, but are (partly) built from string literals, is also\n    incorrect. For example, mutating [unsafe_of_string (\"foo\" ^ s)]\n    could mutate the shared string [\"foo\"] -- assuming a rope-like\n    representation of strings. More generally, functions operating on\n    strings will assume shared ownership, they do not preserve unique\n    ownership. It is thus incorrect to assume unique ownership of the\n    result of [unsafe_of_string].\n\n    The only case we have reasonable confidence is safe is if the\n    produced [bytes] is shared -- used as an immutable byte\n    sequence. This is possibly useful for incremental migration of\n    low-level programs that manipulate immutable sequences of bytes\n    (for example {!Marshal.from_bytes}) and previously used the\n    [string] type for this purpose.\n"]

  " Byte sequence operations.\n\n   A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a\n   fixed-length sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in\n   constant time for reading or writing.\n\n   Given a byte sequence [s] of length [l], we can access each of the\n   [l] bytes of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at\n   [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the\n   range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two\n   bytes or at the beginning or end of the sequence.  We call a\n   position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]\n   (inclusive). Note that the byte at index [n] is between positions\n   [n] and [n+1].\n\n   Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid\n   range of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are valid\n   positions in [s].\n\n   Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the [set]\n   and [blit] functions described below.  See also strings (module\n   {!String}), which are almost the same data structure, but cannot be\n   modified in place.\n\n   Bytes are represented by the OCaml type [char].\n\n   @since 4.02.0\n "]

val unsafe_to_string : bytes -> string[@@ocaml.doc
                                        " Unsafely convert a byte sequence into a string.\n\n    To reason about the use of [unsafe_to_string], it is convenient to\n    consider an \"ownership\" discipline. A piece of code that\n    manipulates some data \"owns\" it; there are several disjoint ownership\n    modes, including:\n    - Unique ownership: the data may be accessed and mutated\n    - Shared ownership: the data has several owners, that may only\n      access it, not mutate it.\n\n    Unique ownership is linear: passing the data to another piece of\n    code means giving up ownership (we cannot write the\n    data again). A unique owner may decide to make the data shared\n    (giving up mutation rights on it), but shared data may not become\n    uniquely-owned again.\n\n   [unsafe_to_string s] can only be used when the caller owns the byte\n   sequence [s] -- either uniquely or as shared immutable data. The\n   caller gives up ownership of [s], and gains ownership of the\n   returned string.\n\n   There are two valid use-cases that respect this ownership\n   discipline:\n\n   1. Creating a string by initializing and mutating a byte sequence\n   that is never changed after initialization is performed.\n\n   {[\nlet string_init len f : string =\n  let s = Bytes.create len in\n  for i = 0 to len - 1 do Bytes.set s i (f i) done;\n  Bytes.unsafe_to_string s\n   ]}\n\n   This function is safe because the byte sequence [s] will never be\n   accessed or mutated after [unsafe_to_string] is called. The\n   [string_init] code gives up ownership of [s], and returns the\n   ownership of the resulting string to its caller.\n\n   Note that it would be unsafe if [s] was passed as an additional\n   parameter to the function [f] as it could escape this way and be\n   mutated in the future -- [string_init] would give up ownership of\n   [s] to pass it to [f], and could not call [unsafe_to_string]\n   safely.\n\n   We have provided the {!String.init}, {!String.map} and\n   {!String.mapi} functions to cover most cases of building\n   new strings. You should prefer those over [to_string] or\n   [unsafe_to_string] whenever applicable.\n\n   2. Temporarily giving ownership of a byte sequence to a function\n   that expects a uniquely owned string and returns ownership back, so\n   that we can mutate the sequence again after the call ended.\n\n   {[\nlet bytes_length (s : bytes) =\n  String.length (Bytes.unsafe_to_string s)\n   ]}\n\n   In this use-case, we do not promise that [s] will never be mutated\n   after the call to [bytes_length s]. The {!String.length} function\n   temporarily borrows unique ownership of the byte sequence\n   (and sees it as a [string]), but returns this ownership back to\n   the caller, which may assume that [s] is still a valid byte\n   sequence after the call. Note that this is only correct because we\n   know that {!String.length} does not capture its argument -- it could\n   escape by a side-channel such as a memoization combinator.\n\n   The caller may not mutate [s] while the string is borrowed (it has\n   temporarily given up ownership). This affects concurrent programs,\n   but also higher-order functions: if {!String.length} returned\n   a closure to be called later, [s] should not be mutated until this\n   closure is fully applied and returns ownership.\n"]


val unsafe_of_string : string -> bytes[@@ocaml.doc
                                        " Unsafely convert a shared string to a byte sequence that should\n    not be mutated.\n\n    The same ownership discipline that makes [unsafe_to_string]\n    correct applies to [unsafe_of_string]: you may use it if you were\n    the owner of the [string] value, and you will own the return\n    [bytes] in the same mode.\n\n    In practice, unique ownership of string values is extremely\n    difficult to reason about correctly. You should always assume\n    strings are shared, never uniquely owned.\n\n    For example, string literals are implicitly shared by the\n    compiler, so you never uniquely own them.\n\n    {[\nlet incorrect = Bytes.unsafe_of_string \"hello\"\nlet s = Bytes.of_string \"hello\"\n    ]}\n\n    The first declaration is incorrect, because the string literal\n    [\"hello\"] could be shared by the compiler with other parts of the\n    program, and mutating [incorrect] is a bug. You must always use\n    the second version, which performs a copy and is thus correct.\n\n    Assuming unique ownership of strings that are not string\n    literals, but are (partly) built from string literals, is also\n    incorrect. For example, mutating [unsafe_of_string (\"foo\" ^ s)]\n    could mutate the shared string [\"foo\"] -- assuming a rope-like\n    representation of strings. More generally, functions operating on\n    strings will assume shared ownership, they do not preserve unique\n    ownership. It is thus incorrect to assume unique ownership of the\n    result of [unsafe_of_string].\n\n    The only case we have reasonable confidence is safe is if the\n    produced [bytes] is shared -- used as an immutable byte\n    sequence. This is possibly useful for incremental migration of\n    low-level programs that manipulate immutable sequences of bytes\n    (for example {!Marshal.from_bytes}) and previously used the\n    [string] type for this purpose.\n"]
